The PODEM-based ATPG program starts by reading the circuit netlist (e.g., s27.txt) using the same parser and data structures as the deductive fault simulators. From this, it builds an internal Circuit object containing the list of primary inputs, primary outputs, gates, and a topological order for simulation. For each specified single stuck-at fault (given on the command line as net/stuck_value, such as 16/0), the program constructs a PODEMEngine instance that knows the circuit, the fault site, and whether the line is stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1. The core PODEM routine then performs a recursive search over primary input assignments: at each step it simulates the circuit with 5-valued logic (0, 1, X, D, ~D), identifies objectives (fault activation or propagation), backtraces those objectives to a primary input, assigns a 0/1 value, and recurses. If a D or ~D appears at any primary output, the search terminates with success and the program formats the final primary input assignments as a test vector, using X for any inputs left as don’t-cares.

Once a candidate test vector is generated for a fault, the program automatically validates it using the existing deductive fault simulator (DFS). At the beginning, it constructs a single DeductiveFaultSimulator object with the same Circuit (sim = DeductiveFaultSimulator(circ)), so the simulator internally knows the full gate-level network and fault list. For each PODEM-generated vector (which may contain X’s), the program creates a concrete 0/1 version for simulation (e.g., by replacing X with 0) and calls sim.detect_for_vector(vec_for_sim, restrict={(net, stuck)}). This DFS routine simulates the circuit under the given input pattern and returns the set of faults detected by that vector. The program then simply checks whether the targeted fault (net, stuck) appears in the returned set; if so, it reports that the PODEM test vector is verified by the deductive fault simulator. In this way,  PODEM generates a test for each specified fault, and the DFS independently confirms whether the vector indeed detects that fault or not.
